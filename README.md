# An-experimental-DL-Model-Program
An extremely rough version of a Deep Learning Program that I made. I plan on making adjustments to this project over time as I figure out new ways to optimize my code
- Made this program for a project at work
- While Neural Network models are commonly built using the Sequential API, circumstances at my job forced me to create models that accepted multiple targets at the same time, which explains why I chose to use the Functional API instead. My true goal is to define a model that accepts any number of targets instead of only being limited to 5 targets at a time, though it is also true that I have never seen anyone use more than 5 target variables in a single model. 
- While I did my best to create a program that accepts any number of targets and defines models based on the number of targets, this ended up being rather tedious and full of bugs which resulted in me scrapping the entire thing altogether and redoing everything from scratch. 
- I plan on slowly making adjustments to this program to make it more concise. A program like this probably doesn't need to be over a few hundred lines to begin with.
